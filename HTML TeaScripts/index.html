    <!-- But the heading's size can be changed using CSS later on , so why HTML has this feature of sizing the headings ? -->
   
    <!-- HTML is not only a markup language , but it's a STRUCTURED LANGAUGE(semantic and syntactical)  -->
    <!-- Defines the structure of your website to the browser which gives the information to the search engines  -->
    
    <!-- h1 -- More importance than h2 -->
    <!-- Browser knows which one to give importance more -->
    <!-- h2 is sub heading  -->
    <!-- Footer -> paragraph -> address  -->
    <!-- 
    
       --- Wrong Structure  
    
    <footer>
        <p>
            address
        </p>
    </footer>
    
      ---Correct Structure  
    
    <footer>
       <address>

       </address>
    </footer> -->
    
   

<!-- Structure is important for a website. -->

<!-- DOCTYPE is HTML (Document type)  -->

<!-- HTML has two childs - head and body  -->
<!-- head -> title  -->

<!-- visual aspect - body tag -->
<!-- head tag has  only favicon and title tag as visual aspect -->

<!-- meta tags for bots and crawlers(Search engines )  -->
<!-- meta tags in html of google  (docs) -->
<!-- meta : all tags will be available by emmet  -->

<!-- Every tag opened should be closed .  -->

<!-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  -->

<!--  br,hr, img  tag are void elements because they are  self closing  . -->
<!-- They are known as void elements because they don't have a closing tag and they don't display any specific content rather serve a specific function . -->


<!-- HTML5 feature :- <br/> <hr/> <img/> -->


<!--  SELF CLOSING TAGS ARE PRESENT IN HTML5 only . -->

<!-- Self closing tags are tags that can stand alone without any closing tag , basically combining both the tags into once. -->
<!-- self closing tags :-  <img> <input> <br> -->


<!-- tags are also known as elements but they are always not the same . -->

<!-- All elements are tags but all tags are  not elements . -->

<!-- Ex - p tag in a tag but it can have other attributes under it , or other tags under it , so when a tag has more tags inside it as an attribute then it's called an element which can be called as tag of tags .  -->
<!-- Elements have their tags as well as their content , start tag , content and then the end tag  -->
<!-- Whereas the tags only have start and end tag without any content  -->
